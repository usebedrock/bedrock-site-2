<h2>Working with Pug</h2>
<p>Pug is a specific template language that focuses on writing as little syntax as possible. Next to this, it has many powerful features such as <a href="https://pugjs.org/language/conditionals.html" target="_blank">conditionals</a>, <a href="https://pugjs.org/language/includes.html" target="_blank">includes</a> and <a href="https://pugjs.org/language/inheritance.html" target="_blank">template inheritance</a>.</p>
<p>It can be difficult at first when coming from just HTML, but trust us that after you wrote some Pug, you might just like it as much as we do.</p>
<p>On this page we will give you a very brief introduction to working with Pug. In this table, on the left you will see some HTML, and on the right the Pug equivalent.</p>

<h3>Tip: use .editorconfig</h3>
<p>Note that Pug is very sensitive to indentation and correct whitespace. Itâ€™s handy to download <a href="http://editorconfig.org/">editorconfig</a> for your favorite editor to keep indentation consistent.</p>
