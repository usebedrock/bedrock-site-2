<h2>Styling the style guide</h2>

<p>Since Bedrock 1.10 it is possible to style the style guide in a structured way.</p>
<p>To do this you need to set up some project variables according to your projectâ€™s CSS.</p>
<p>For the available variables, please reference this <a href="https://github.com/usebedrock/bedrock/blob/master/core/templates/mixins/styleguide-settings.pug">file</a>.</p>
<p>You can override these variables in your own project to style the styleguide. An example from the Bootstrap Bedrock base can be found <a href="https://github.com/usebedrock/bedrock/blob/bootstrap4base/content/templates/_layouts/master.pug">here</a>.</p>
<p>(If you are curious, more info in <a href="https://github.com/usebedrock/bedrock/issues/201">#201</a>)</p>
