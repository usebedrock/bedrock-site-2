The new Bedrock strategy is one to drive public adoption to the tool, so it becomes better. In order for this to happen, we need to remove as much friction as possible.

We've heard that some people have been experimenting with Bedrock, which we are very happy about.

Based on feedback we have received, we added the following to the documentation:

- [Adding external CSS libraries](https://bedrock.mono.company/documentation/adding-external-css-libraries/)
- [Adding jQuery](https://bedrock.mono.company/documentation/adding-jquery/)

Are you struggling with something? E-mail us, comment on this post, just let us know, and we will add an explanation on how to achieve it.
