We released Bedrock 1.1! We fixed some remaining bugs and made it easier to use dark mode - you only need to set a single config variable to use it. Grab the release at [Github](https://github.com/mono-company/bedrock/releases/tag/1.1final) or use Bedrock's CLI tool to [upgrade](http://bedrock.mono.company/2017/02/25/upgrading-bedrock/).
