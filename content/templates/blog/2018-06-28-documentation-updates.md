Coinciding with the 1.10 release we updated some of the **documentation**.

The basic tutorial received a [revision,](https://bedrockapp.org/documentation/basic-tutorial/)Â which includes an all-new screencast to get started with Bedrock:

The explanation for [page index and tree](https://bedrockapp.org/documentation/page-index-and-tree/) was revised.

Working with Pug changed into a basic [Working with Pug](https://bedrockapp.org/documentation/working-with-pug/) and a more advanced [Advanced Pug tips](https://bedrockapp.org/documentation/advanced-pug-tips/).

A new section was added about [Styling the style guide](https://bedrockapp.org/documentation/styling-the-style-guide/) - make the style guide your own. This is still a work in progress.
