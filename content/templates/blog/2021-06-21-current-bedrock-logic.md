_Updated June_ _22_

Just a note for those interested - there's a lot of activity on the repos, here is the current version logic:

- Stable: 1.33.0
- Development: 1.34.0
    - PurgeCSS feature
    - PostCSS
- Canary: 1.38
    - Minification of JS and CSS feature
    - Development and production builds

As we use the Canary and Development versions in real projects and bugs get fixed, we will move them to a **stable** release**.**

Do note that we put [detailed release notes on Github](https://github.com/usebedrock/bedrock).
