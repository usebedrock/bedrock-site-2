We have updated the documentation, where sometimes the old command to start Bedrock (`gulp`) was mentioned. Now it should talk about `npm start` everywhere.

Next to this the requirement for Bedrock was stated to be Node at version 8, but recently this has changed to Node 10 (`node stable`). The documentation was subsequently changed.
