I whipped up a quick [homepage](http://bedrock.mono.company/) for Bedrock today. The URL for the Bedrock "marketing" site will be [http://bedrock.mono.company](http://bedrock.mono.company). The blog will live at [http://bedrock.mono.company/blog](http://bedrock.mono.company/blog) . So use that last URL in your favorite feed reader if you want to stay up to date.

This home page contains some information about what Bedrock is, along with some [screencasts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrLhHQohPDnuQ5Sh4RFyzsg/playlists) that I made yesterday and a link to a demo application. We are developing Bedrock in the open from now, so you might see some mistakes here and there.
