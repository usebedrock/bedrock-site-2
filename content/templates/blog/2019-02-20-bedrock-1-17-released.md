We've been hard at work improving Bedrock. Over the past two weeks we have added a **search function** to the styleguide, the **ability to add your own logo**, as well as **ways to mark components as “unofficial” in the sidebar as well as on the components page** (i.e. to mark components as something that you customised).

You can see the newest version of Bedrock in action in our Bedrock bases:

- [Bootstrap 4 base](http://bs4base.bedrockapp.org/styleguide/docs/introduction.html)
- [Material Base](http://materialbase.bedrockapp.org/styleguide)

We realize that the usage of some of the features might be a bit obscure, and we hope to make it more clear how to implement and use these in the near future.
