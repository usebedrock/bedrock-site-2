Bedrock is one year old! We started this project about a year ago, and we've been updating and refining Bedrock since.

We use Bedrock for most of our projects at Mono. HTML prototyping is a staple of our workflow; and it's something we've talked about [extensively](https://mono.company/effective-ui-design-html-prototyping-frontend-united/) in the past.

We're at the point where Bedrock's features have stabilized, and have been in actual use in many projects.

After some recent development work I concluded that Bedrock is feature complete. I'm ready to call this stable and thus a 1.0 is in order. You can download Bedrock 1.0 on [Github](https://github.com/mono-company/bedrock).

What's next for Bedrock? Well, at Mono we often use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for our projects. We've customized Bootstrap 3 with a lot of extra components which we think are worth sharing.

I plan to make a new demo that shows the power of Bedrock combined with Bootstrap. While developing the demo I am going to record my screen and turn it into a session that anyone can watch, to see the process.

Next to this, I want to revise the documentation to make it easier for newcomers to get started. Bedrock is a relatively simple tool to use, but you have to know some details to use it effectively.

P.S. A huge shoutout to [Thomas](http://thomastuts.com/) for his coding efforts. If you need a fine React developer, hire him!
