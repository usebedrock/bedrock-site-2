The Bedrock command line interface has been updated. `bedrock-cli@2.0.0` was published last Friday. These are the commands you can run:

- `bedrock init [base]` where `base` is `material` or `bootstrap4`
    - Provides an easy way to get a new Bedrock project going using one of the Bedrock bases
- `bedrock upgrade` and `bedrock upgrade --dev`, the latter command will pull changes from the `develop` branch instead of `master`

You can get the latest version of the Bedrock CLI by installing it globally with `npm install bedrock-cli -g`.
