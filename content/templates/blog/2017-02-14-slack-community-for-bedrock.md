I am trying something new - using Slack as a support/community channel for Bedrock. So if you are interested in Bedrock, want some help to set things up - send an e-mail to jr@mono.company and I will set you up with a Slack invite.

The community URL is [bedrock-hq.slack.com/](https://bedrock-hq.slack.com/).
