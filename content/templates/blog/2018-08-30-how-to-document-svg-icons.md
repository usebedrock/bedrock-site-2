Given a folder of SVG icons in Bedrock 1.10, you can document it with the following code:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Wolfr/bdfd95c0f357d4db1083016dd304eede.js"></script>

We will be improving the documentation on how to document colors and icons in the future. For now, I will be posting little useful snippets as I encounter (or code ðŸ¤“) them.
