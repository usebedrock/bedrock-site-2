One of the "blocking" factors in learning to use Bedrock is that you have to know how to work with [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/).

Jade is a powerful templating language built on top of node.js.

The first time I encountered Jade I thought it was unnecessary to abstract HTML into something else. But after a few months on a project using Jade, going back to HTML felt tiring. You really have to type double as much code when you are writing HTML.

The main advantage of Jade is that you can't forget to close HTML tags: the way that Jade works just doesn't allow for that to happen. This reduces code mistakes significantly.

What I mostly love about Jade is **blocks** and **extending templates**. This system is explained [here](http://jade-lang.com/reference/extends/). I make use of this extensively to make sure I never have to write duplicate code in a project.

I made a screencast how Jade is used in Bedrock:

Who else is using Jade out there?
