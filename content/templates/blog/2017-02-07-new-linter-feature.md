We've started working on a linter which allows you to test your template code for HTML errors. You can easily create your own tests. Use cases include avoiding common HTML mistakes like forgetting `for` attributes on form labels. This feature is being worked on and will be released when it's tested by more people. Feel free to check out the [PR](https://github.com/mono-company/bedrock/pull/134).
