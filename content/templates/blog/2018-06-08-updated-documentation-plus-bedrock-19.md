We have updated the documentation for Bedrock.

- The [documentation for using JS data in your projects](https://bedrockapp.org/documentation/working-with-data/) is now more extensiveÂ and more accurate
- The [configuration](https://bedrockapp.org/documentation/configuration/) is now listed in a clearer table
- The [working with Pug](https://bedrockapp.org/documentation/working-with-pug/) section has been updated to give some hints specific to using Pug within Bedrock

We also released Bedrock 1.9. Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/usebedrock/bedrock/releases/tag/1.9) on Github.

We are working on a new version of Bedrock, that will improve Bedrock as a whole. Stay tuned!
