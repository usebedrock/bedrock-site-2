A few days ago I tested an interesting alternative to Bedrock, called [Fractal](http://fractal.build/).

It's more of a component style guide that can be added to any project than a prototyping tool, but there are a lot of similarities.

It builds on a lot of similar ideas as Bedrock, so me this is a validation that what we are doing here is right.
