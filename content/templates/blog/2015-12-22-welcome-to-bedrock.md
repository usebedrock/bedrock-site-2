At [Mono](http://mono.company) we have been making HTML prototypes for years, and we decided to open source some of the technology behind it in the form of a static site generator called Bedrock.

The code for Bedrock can be found at [Github](https://github.com/mono-company/bedrock/). Stay tuned for some more blog posts that show some of the cool stuff you can do with it.
