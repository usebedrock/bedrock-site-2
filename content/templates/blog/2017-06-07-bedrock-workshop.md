This summer we will be organising a Bedrock workshop afternoon where I will teach people how to use Bedrock.

If you are interested [ping me](http://twitter.com/wolfr_) on Twitter. Currently there are 2-3 people up for it, please join in! I will likely set up a Doodle to pinpoint a good date.

Follow [@usebedrock](https://twitter.com/usebedrock) to stay up to date.
