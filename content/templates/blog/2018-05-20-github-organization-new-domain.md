As part of the planned evolutions for Bedrock, we now have a new Github organization that will host all Bedrock related repositories.

For now, the 2 public repositories available on Bedrock are Bedrock itself and our CLI tool.

We have also registered the bedrockapp.org domain, which will be the new domain for this website soon.

If you work on Bedrock, please update your git remotes! The new URL for Bedrock itself is `https://github.com/usebedrock/bedrock` and `git@github.com:usebedrock/bedrock.git`.
