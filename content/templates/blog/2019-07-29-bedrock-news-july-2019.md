I've clarified the documentation of the [page tree and index](http://bedrockapp.org/documentation/page-index-and-tree/) page as well as the [working with Pug](http://bedrockapp.org/documentation/working-with-pug/) page.

Next to this, some missing documentation was added to “[Working with the style guide](http://bedrockapp.org/documentation/working-with-the-styleguide/)”. It pained me slightly that it took us a full year to complete this.

One might be concerned about the lack of updates to Bedrock, but rest assured - for me this is just proof that the software is stable and working, and does what it needs to do. Personally, I haven't needed a new feature in a while, but I use Bedrock quite often, which I believe is a great sign.

I would like it more people used Bedrock though. So if you use Bedrock or if you are interested to start using Bedrock, feel free to post on our [issues](https://github.com/usebedrock/bedrock/issues) page. Let us know how you are using Bedrock, any problems you encounter or anything else that is on your mind (as long as it's about Bedrock 😎!).
