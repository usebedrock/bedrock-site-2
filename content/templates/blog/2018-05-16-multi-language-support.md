We updated Bedrock to include basic multi language support. It is a very simple implementation that is mainly meant for quickly testing prototypes in multiple languages.

We don't recommend using this sort of code in production, but it can be helpful for small-scale language testing (e.g. UI label testing or usability tests). Check out the [documentation](https://bedrock.mono.company/documentation/multi-language-support/).
