New release! Or actually 2 new point releases. I never really know what a “feature” and a “bugfix” is in the case of Bedrock. In any case, here are some improvements:

- Use [water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/) for default look (you never get the chance to make a 2nd impression...!)
- Deploy Bedrock to standard demo URL for reference (using Vercel): [https://bedrock-sand.vercel.app/](https://bedrock-sand.vercel.app/)
- Improved usage examples styleguide
    - The styleguide makes it clearer how to add examples with named sources or how to mark components as custom; as well as how to provide custom component categories
- Add ability to append footer to component docs - see demo [https://bedrock-sand.vercel.app/styleguide/c-example-footer-docs.html](https://bedrock-sand.vercel.app/styleguide/c-example-footer-docs.html) (thank you to [heldtogether](https://github.com/heldtogether) 🙌!)

Peace out!
