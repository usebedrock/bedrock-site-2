The last time we reported about Bedrock, we were at version 1.19.

If you follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/usebedrock), you might have heard about Bedrock 2. That's a separate story from Bedrock 1, using Javascript frameworks as a base setup instead of a custom Gulp-based static site generator (Bedrock 1).

We'll be reporting about Bedrock 2 when it is more evolved.

The latest Bedrock version is 1.25.1. Compared to 1.19, there are the following major changes:

### Technical maintenance

- Improved default config logic
- Use Gulp 4 instead of Gulp 3
- Use the latest LTS version of Node (no need to use nvm anymore if you use Node 14)

### Deprecations

- Removed linter feature

### Usage

- Any component prefixed with `_` should be ignored in component list in styleguide
- Improvement: Ignore root page directories that start with an underscore

We are continuing to support Bedrock as we use it in our own projects.
