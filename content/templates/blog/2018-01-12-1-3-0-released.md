In Bedrock 1.3.0 we made a change where as a user, you can now access the category listing in the component styleguide. For example, if you prefix all your "Company X" components with `x-`, you can list these as separate items in the styleguide. You can find more info in [#186](https://github.com/mono-company/bedrock/issues/186).
