<h3>Basic requirements</h3>
<h4>Node</h4>
<p>You will need a recent version of <strong>node.js</strong> on your system. To check if you have node installed, open a Terminal window and run the command <code>node -v</code>. You should see a version number. If you installed Node through the Node package installer you should definitely be okay! We recommend node 14.15.0 because that’s what we use to develop Bedrock.</p>
<p>If you don’t have node installed, you can <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">download the installer from nodejs.org</a>. Choose the stable version.</p>
